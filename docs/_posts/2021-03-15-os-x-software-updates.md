title:  "Software Updates for older versions of Mac OS X"
---
Apple used to provide automatic updates of Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X through Software Update. However, as of mid-2014, only Mac OS X 10.4 and later can use Software Update. This can be frustrating for retrocomputing enthusiasts like me.

Some time ago, I researched and archived software updates for every version of Mac OS X I could find. Here's a list of those updates.

## Mac OS X 10.0 Cheetah
As Mac OS X 10.0 was quickly replaced by 10.1, I was only able to determine these three updates apply to it:
  * Mac OS X 10.0.4 Combo Update
  * Software Update 1.3.1
  * iTunes for Mac OS X 1.1
	  
## Mac OS X 10.1 Puma
  * Mac OS X 10.1.5 Combo Update
  * Installer Update 1.0
  * Networking Update 1.0
  * DVD Player 3.1.1
  * AirPort 3.0.4
  * Apple Remote Desktop 1.2
  * Internet Explorer 5.2.3
  * iMovie 3.0.3
  * Java 1.3.1 Update 1
  * QuickTime 6.3.1
  * Security Update 2002-07-18
  * Security Update 2002-08-02
  * Security Update 2002-11-21
  * Security Update 2004-01-26
