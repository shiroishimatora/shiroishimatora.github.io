title:  "Building a 486 Gaming PC"
---
Over the summer, I built a 486-based PC for playing DOS games. I didn’t document my progress along the way, so I’m documenting it now retrospectively.
### Why build such an old PC?
I was watching some of LGR’s videos and started thinking about building a PC to play some DOS games I’ve never heard of before. It seemed like a fun research project as well, figuring out how to which components to select and how to build a working PC from them.
### How much money did you spend on this?
Too much.
### How did you select which components to use?
#### Processor
First, I set a target for which processor I wanted to use. I picked the fastest 486, an Intel DX4-100. I debated on using newer Cyrix or AMD 486-compatible processors, but decided to stick with a real Intel 486. Slower 25 or 33 MHz processors did not interest me. I wanted the fastest of the 486 era.

#### Motherboard
Next, I did some research on chipsets. I found the general consensus to be that SiS made the best 486-era chipsets, specifically their SiS 496/497. I started looking up which motherboards use that chipset and found a nice ASUS board called the PVI-486SP3. It seems to be well regarded by users on Vogons. They pop up on eBay occasionally and at a high price. Most sellers were international as well. When one from a US-based seller appeared, I jumped on it.
