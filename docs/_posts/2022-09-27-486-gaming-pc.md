title:  "Building a 486 Gaming PC"
---
Over the summer, I built a 486-based PC for playing DOS games. I didn’t document my progress along the way, so I’m documenting it now retrospectively.
### Why build such an old PC?
I was watching some of LGR’s videos and started thinking about building a PC to play some DOS games I’ve never heard of before. It seemed like a fun research project as well, figuring out how to which components to select and how to build a working PC from them.
### How much money did you spend on this?
Too much.
### How did you select which components to use?
#### Processor
First, I set a target for which processor I wanted to use. I picked the fastest i486, an Intel DX4-100. I debated on using newer Cyrix or AMD 486-compatible processors, but decided to stick with an Intel 486. Early 25 or 33 MHz processors just do not interest me, I want the fastest of the 486 era. Despite its DX4 name, the external processor bus is 33 MHz with a 3x clock multiplier for an internal operating frequency of 100 MHz.

#### Motherboard
Next, I did some research on chipsets. I found the general consensus to be that SiS made the best 486-era chipsets, specifically their SiS 496/497. I started looking up which motherboards use that chipset and found a nice ASUS board called the PVI-486SP3. It seems to be well regarded by users on Vogons. Socket 4 with 3 PCI and four ISA slots, one of which is also VESA Local Bus. It has a good, stable Award BIOS that is fairly easy to use. It supports up to 512 KB of L2 cache and 128 MB of RAM through two 72-pin SIMMs. Notably, it uses a standard CR-2032 for CMOS instead of a soldered lithium or pesky Dallas RTC. And while it does have a good bit of onboard I/O, I do not use most of it. These boards pop up on eBay occasionally and at a high price. Most sellers were international as well. When one from a US-based seller appeared, I bought it immediately.

#### Case
I had been searching for an AT-compatible case for a while. A listing for a new-in-box desktop style AT case popped up. Turns out it’s an old, new stock Micro Center case sold by Micro Center’s eBay account. It was in pristine condition and came with an AT-style power supply as well. Despite the expense, I just had to have it. I liked the case styling and the bundled PSU was a nice bonus.

#### Cards
##### Video
I happened to have an **ATI Mach32 VLB** video card, so I used that. Compared to other VLB video cards, it is respectable in terms of performance. Though the Diamond Stealth 64 VLB VRAM is still the performance champion for the era.
##### Sound
Using a SoundBlaster 16 was the obvious choice. But the hard part is choosing which variant. Originally, I had chosen and purchased a SoundBlaster 16 CT1770 as it could be obtained at a reasonable cost. But I found a **SoundBlaster 16 CT1740** in my basement and used that instead.
##### SCSI
For this build, I decided to go entirely with SCSI for storage. Being a user of classic Macs, I’ve come to appreciate SCSI. That, and SCSI was generally used on high-end PCs of the era. I chose the **Adaptec AHA-1542CF**, though I won’t use its onboard floppy controller.
##### Network
This one was a bit harder to choose.
