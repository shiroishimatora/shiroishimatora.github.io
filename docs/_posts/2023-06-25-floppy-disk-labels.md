# INTRO AREA

# Actually making labels
The first step was to measure the front, spine, and rear label areas of a 3.5" floppy disk. The front label area is 2.75 inches wide and 2.125 (2 1/8) inches tall. The spine is 2.75 inches wide and 0.125 (1/8) inches tall. The rear label area is 2.75 inches wide and 0.75 inches tall. The three label areas sum together to form a 2.75 inch square with rounded corners.
