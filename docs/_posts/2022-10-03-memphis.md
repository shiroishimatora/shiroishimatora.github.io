title:  "Memphis: building a PC to run Windows 98"
---
In fall of 2019, I built a PC to run Windows 98 games.
### Why are you building a PC rather an use Virtualbox?
Many games do not work well in a VM. Notably, sound is hard to get working properly. And several games I’ve tried have graphical glitches. Because these operating systems are so old, some VMs drop support for them in their guest OS driver packs. So I’m going native on real hardware.
### Why call it Memphis?
Memphis was the codename of Windows 98.
### Why not use Windows 95, NT 4.0, Me, or 2000?
My first PC that I played point-and-click adventure games on ran Windows 95. Not that I have anything against it, but I wanted something a little newer. Windows 98’s features and hardware support is substantially better than that of Windows 95. As for NT, Windows NT 4.0 just isn’t that good for gaming, it has limited OpenGL, DirectX, and general driver support. Windows Me is notoriously panned and lacks real-mode DOS support. And Windows 2000 is just a bit too new for what I want. So, Windows 98 Second Edition is what I chose.
